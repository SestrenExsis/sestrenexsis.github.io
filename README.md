## Studying

### Calculating which study day today is using Wolfram Alpha

You can use [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) to figure out which "study day" you are on (say, for using flashcards with the [Leitner system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system)) with the following URL:

[https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%28%28number+of+days+since+2000%29+%2F+day%29+%2B+2%29+mod+10](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%28%28number+of+days+since+2000%29+%2F+day%29+%2B+2%29+mod+10)

If you need your first day of study to start at 0, you can adjust the offset (in the example above, 2) to suit your needs. If you need a different number of study days to cycle through, adjust the modulus (in the example above, 10).
